						Today, I am going to begin by talking about the problems that this research is aimed to address <br>
						I am then going to briefly explain the methodology and show how this is a unique approach to web-based modeling, but also modeling in general <br>
						I will then demonstrate how we can use this approach through a series of three projects <br>
						Finally, I'll discuss the implications of this work, its limitations, and some suggestions for future research <br>

						<aside class="notes">
							The model understanding problem is sometimes called the black box problem <br>
							You give the model some input, it performs some computations, and generates some output. <br>
							But how do we know how the model converts the input data into outputs? <br>
							Most people would say: well, you have to know the equations <br>
							And this is often called the model theory <br>
							But are the equations and the theory really the same thing? <br>
							I would argue that the equations are really a representation of theory. <br>
							Equations are based on mathematical notation and abstract symbols to represent quantities, processes and relationships <br>
							But those abstract symbols really have an underlying meaning <br>
							For example, consider a model that represents the decay of a pollutant as a first order process <br>
							Most of us could write down a differential equation representing that process, but what that equaiton means is that the rate of change is linearly proportional to the concentration <br>
							But unless you've studied this equation before, it may not be entirely obvious what the behavior is <br>
							So it's sometimes hard to deduce based on the equations alone, what the underlying theory is <br>
							And so there's another representation of theory called visualizations<br>
							And when you look in textbooks or journal articles, you'll find a variety of visualizations designed to help understanding the shape of an equation, or the components of the model <br>
							And you can really think of these visualizations as an alternative representation of model theory <br>

						<aside class="notes">
							The second problem is model accessibility <br>
							There are two aspects to this problem <br>
							There is the physical accessibility, that is whether someone can obtain and execute the model software <br>
							There is also technical accessibility, that is how easy it is to use the software <br>
							When you read in the literature about the use of models for management and decision making, you find a lot of discussion about the need to make models more accessible, we need to put them in the hands of stakeholders and decision makers so that they can use the model to explore the system behavior and decision space. <br>
							So this is really where the web can play a major role. By making models accessible over the web, avoiding the need to install or purchase special software, eliminating compatibility problems, and allowing anyone with an Internet connection and standard web browser to access and interact with the model.

						<aside class="notes">
							The model life cycle is often described as a cyclical process. <br>
							A model is created to support some management plan or make some decision, a lot of financial resources and human labor goes into configuring the model. It is applied to compare alternative scenarios or decisions, and then the project is complete. <br>
							But after that initial project is complete, the model goes into a state of hibernation. It is basically left idly sitting on someone's hard drive, not doing anything. <br>
							A few years go by, and another project comes along and the model is resurrected to evaluate the effectiveness of the previous plan or decision or to support some new project. And it goes through a process of model updates. New input and observation data are compiled to extend the simulation period, and the model is run over more recent years. <br>
							So this is clearly a cyclical process, but it is also somewhat sporadic or fragmented. We create a model, apply it, let it sit, then update it and apply again, and so on. <br>
							And so all this time that the model is left sitting idle in its state of hibernation is a waste of the resources and knowledge that went into creating the model in the first place. <br>
							Furthermore, the process of updating a model is fairly time consuming and expensive. <br>
							Today, much of this process can be automated now that most datasets are available and frequently updated right on the web. <br>
							So all this data is sitting out there, ready to go. It's a matter of retreiving it, processing it, and feeding into the model to update the input datasets and extend the simulation. <br>
							If we can do this, then the model life cycle becomes more stream-lined or continuous. <br>
							So instead of this traditional cycle of apply the model, let it sit, update the model, apply it, let it sit, the model can be continuously updated as new data become available, and then it can also be continuously applied. <br>
							So this would be a more cost-effective use of the model and increase the rate of return on the initial investment in the model's creation.
